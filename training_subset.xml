    WHAT ARE SMOKE ALARMS ?  Smoke alarms are small plastic devices which can be fitted by most people in their homes .  They cost around 1015 each for the battery - <head>operated</head> models . Smoke alarms can detect smoke from fires in their earliest stages and sound a loud warning alarm .  Of course ,  you will need to go on taking basic fire safety precautions even when smoke alarms are fitted in your home .

    As Arendt  ( 1958 )  indicated ,  the more public a group ,  the less power it is likely to have .  Real power ,  she clearly demonstrates ,  begins where secrecy exists .  It should come as no surprise , therefore , to find that detailed ethnography of police social practice is antithetical to the philosophies of control by which they <head>operate</head> . Yet in a liberal democracy ,  such a declaration cannot easily be made ;  indeed the opposite must be proclaimed .  To carry out participant observation into the minutiae of police practice might be theoretically approved in any statement made for general consumption ,  but in the cold light of institutional reality it will most likely be thwarted or subverted even as it is being agreed .

    Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos , a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem , and the detective and the chief officer now <head>operate</head> at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they produce . Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .

    It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have remained the province of the archbishop and his clergy .  The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner ( 1989 ) , writing on the collective culture of chief constables , is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society , simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they <head>operate</head> , link together , or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions . Across the history of policing their need has always been for the light of research to illuminate the activities of the underprivileged and the powerless ,  rather than focus upon the lite themselves !  Analysis of police culture is therefore particularly suited to the anthropological method ,  for it requires an extended field study to reveal much about the unspoken agenda which determines many aspects of police practice .

    It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who <head>operate</head> with a degree of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

    For analytic purposes ,  these can be cast into a binary model ,  suggesting positive and negative polarities of :   Such spatial and temporal fixations are also deliberately elaborated in other institutions of control ,  such as the armed forces .  There we find similar bodily constructs built up as series of organizing principles , so that the other regiment or unit is perceived to <head>operate</head> in some kind of polluted time and space , and its aberrant nuances of uniform styling used as a marker of significant difference . The police also use concepts of a disciplined body in their dealings to effect the capture of the local villains  ( or prigs )  .  In any public confrontation a quick assessment and early resolution is the order of the day ,  for on the streets pragmatism always rules and real polises set out immediately to fix their adversaries by using deeply imbued constructs relating to time and space .

    The congress has been brought forward by a year ,  in what is being interpreted as a victory for the leader of the reformist wing of the party ,  Imre Pozsgay .  He is reportedly hoping to oust Karoly Grosz as General Secretary .  The <head>party</head> may well face further depletion with the expected defection of some members to set up yet another social democratic opposition <head>party</head> . Mr Grosz ,  59 ,  has been overtaken ,  some would say swamped ,  by the wave of reforms he unleashed after displacing Janos Kadar as Hungarian leader in May 1987 .  Now he finds himself in the same position as his predecessor  a relative conservative whose time is past .

    His faction has triumphed over the reformist elements of Christian Democracy ,  headed by the ousted leader and premier ,  Ciriaco De Mita .  In the sweetness of victory ,  Mr Andreotti 's  Roman cohorts have forgotten that they are mortal and ,  in the eyes of many churchmen ,  their greed and arrogance now risk bringing Catholic politics into disrepute .  The Pope 's Vicar of Rome , Cardinal Ugo Poletti , has taken to scolding the Christian Democrats for their divisions which may bring victory for the secular <head>parties</head> and the Communists in city elections on 29 October . A public rift in Catholic politics surfaced last week when the Communion and Liberation movement severed its ties with a powerful weekly magazine ,  Il Sabato ,  run by Andreotti supporters .  The magazine exploited popular Catholic themes ,  such as anti - abortion campaigning and family values to channel middle - class resentment into a political movement .

    Make no mistake ,  money is now a cancer in the game .  Our game really is in danger of dying from too much of it .  You cannot blame a brilliant young player who takes , say , the 200,000 he or she is offered , to <head>play</head> just for one night but it inevitably gives them a totally false impression of life and what their tennis priorities ought to be . But when you have a situation where youngsters of 12 or 13  and in some cases even younger  who may only have won a couple of matches ,  are being offered 500,000 guarantees to sign up with one of the management companies before they are snapped up by one of the rival agents ,  the potential for long term damage is enormous .  This year ,  in prize money alone ,  there is well over 100m available for professional players round the world ,  including team events such as The David Cup and The Federation Cup .

    If you do not believe me ,  then listen to how Steffi Graf and Monica Seles let the cat out of the bag in Paris .  First ,  Steffi admitted The women 's  event does n't really start before the second week after most of the top seeds had advanced for no more than the loss of a few games .  Then Monica , in apparently wanting the ITF to change the Olympic eligibility rules to suit top players who did not want to qualify by <head>playing</head> in the Federation Cup , said without Gabriela , Martina or I in the Olympics , they would n't really be the Olympics and Steffi could win the gold medal <head>playing</head> left - handed . Ouch !   ( Editor 's  note :  We would be interested to hear readers views on the WTA proposal to increase the numbers of seeds in Grand Slam tournaments )

    Now ,  there is an added urgency to her shots and she remains an unlikely threat to both grass court opponents and ,   ( following her victory in the 1990 French Open and her re - appearance in the final again this year )  ,  clay court specialists .  Sanchez - Vicario gambled on power ,  played for the lines and left her opponents ,  particularly the vastly experienced but hopelessly out of sorts Pam Shriver and the Puerto Rican ,  Gigi Fernandez ,  floundering .  Shriver 's recent long term absence from the tour , following shoulder surgery , and her lack of match practice were shown up by an opponent who was <head>playing</head> the women 's game of today , powerful and merciless . Shriver ,  good humoured as she was in her quarter final defeat ,  played yesterday 's  tennis .  Despite the humour ,  which was lapped up by an appreciative crowd ,  it was a sad spectacle and one that must have left her regretting her comments ,  when asked about her chances at Wimbledon .
